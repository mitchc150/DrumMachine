# Virtual Drum Machine

## An app for musicians and anyone interested in making new sounds!

This will be an application in which users can place various drum sounds in sequences and then loop the beat which 
results. Some examples of drum sounds I will include, all of which come with the basic MIDI standard are:
- Kick drum 
- Open and closed hi-hat
- Snare drum
- Ride cymbal
- Timpani

And many more. The app is intended for pianists, guitarists and other musicians who want to create backing tracks while 
they play, as well as any other people who are interested in making simple beats and rhythms. This project is of 
interest to me because I am a musician, and I find it useful to have drum accompaniment to keep 
me on rhythm, to fill out the sound and to help with songwriting. I also really enjoy playing with rhythms and I will 
find it fun to create new patterns on the app.
